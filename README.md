# Health helper
Milestone Project Two: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website for a service that provides information for recipes nad meal plans, named 'Health helper'. The website includes information for the services they provide, a section for each service and a contact form for easier communication. 


## Demo 
A demo of the website can  be found [here](https://diovcharova.github.io/milestoneproject2/).

## UX
The website is targeted at people, interested in nutrition and diets. It is also intended to make it easier for users to come up with ideas on what to cook. 
The design on the webiste is very simple and stripped of complicated structures. That is because it is vital for users to be able to easy navigate and find the information they are looking for. The structure of the different sections is the same for futher accomodate ease of use. The colors, typography and pictures are as neutral as possible, and only complement the main content.  

### User stories
* As a user with a specific intolerance, I want to be able to find recipes, based on a different type of cuisine, such as Italian or Thai. 
* As a user I want to find recipes that combine the ingredients I already have in stock.
* As a person trying to watch my weight, I want to follow a healthy and diverse diet, but with a specific target of daily calory intake. A daily meal planner is a easy way of sticking to my goal, while not struggling to come up with recipes.
* As a vegetarian, I would like to be able to easily find recipes, that do not involve foods I am intolerant to. 

### UX based design
Based on the user stories, I got a clearer idea of the required features on the website. As part of the design process, I developed a wireframe [See more.](.../assets/mockups&wireframes/Health helper wireframe.png) and a mockup [See more.](.../assets/mockups&wireframes/Health helper mockup.png).

## Features

### Existing Features
The header and footer in all pages are identical. The navbar is in the form of a dropdown menu and is always collpased. The footer consists of links to the different sections, as well as links to social media accounts. In the 'Our Story' section, there are cards with links to the three services provided, which appear horizontally on a medium to large screen. At smaller sized screens, they are displayed vertically after each other. Each section contains a form with a submit button, which, when pressed, triggers a call to the Spoonacular API. The results are displayed in the form of a list of links to recipes. The contact page is a form, which enables the user to contact the company more easily and is linked to EmailJS, which automatically sends the company an email whenever someone fills in the form.
